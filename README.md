## Coincidence Detection and Integration Behavior in Spiking Neural Networks

This repository contains the code generated during the study "Coincidence Detection and Integration Behavior in Spiking Neural Networks". It is currently under review.

# Analysis

This folder contains scripts with resource-intensive computations. The results will be stored in the "results" folder and will be used by the scripts located in the "Plots" folder.
Please start the analysis procedure by running extract_decay_times.py and compute_input_output_spikes.py as the results are fundamental for most other scripts. Thus, they will assert a correct folder structure.


# Plots

These scripts will create the figures as presented in the paper.


# Models

The training scripts will store a untrained and trained model in this folder.


# Results

The results from "Analysis" and "Plots" will be stored here. In "Results/Figures", the plots as found in the paper will be stored.


# TF_Spiking

An adjusted version from the tf_spiking package. Its original version can be found on [https://github.com/rgerum/tf_spiking][here].

# Training

Local versions of the datasets, brightness adjustment scripts as well as training scripts are stored here.
